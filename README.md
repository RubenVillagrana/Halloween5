Format the body of the page so it’s 800 pixels wide, has a white background, has a black
border with a shadow, and is centered in the browser window. Add a background image behind the body of the page that uses the bats.gif file in the
images folder. This image should repeat both horizontally and vertically. Add a black border below the header and above the footer.
Remove the shadow, italics, and color from the first heading in the header. Add a 45-degree gradient to the header and footer. The gradient in the header should
range from white at the left to orange ¾ of the way to the right to black at the right. The
gradient in the footer should be the reverse. Adjust the margins and padding for the elements on the page so it looks as shown above.
